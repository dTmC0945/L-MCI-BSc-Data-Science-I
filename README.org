** Lecture Information

- The goal of this lecture is to give you a working understanding
  of data analysis and give you the practical mathematical knowledge
  for use in Data Science II.
- While some parts will be done with pen and paper we will work with
  python for solving some applications.

The structure for this lecture is as follows.
