** Lecture Information

- *WARNING:* This is the content only covered by me as this lecture is shared by
  both me and Dr. Julian Huber.
    
- The goal of this lecture is to give you a working understanding
  of data analysis and give you the practical mathematical knowledge
  for use in Data Science II and future lectures/applications.
- While some parts will be done with pen and paper we will work with
  python for solving some applications as lecture goes on.

The structure for this lecture is as follows.

  will be three (3) assignments where you need to solve given questions using
  python programming language and/or standard pen and paper.

| ASSIGNMENT TYPE | VALUE |
| HW 1            |    30 |
| HW 2            |    30 |
| HW 3            |    40 |
